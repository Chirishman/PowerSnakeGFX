# PowerSnakeGFX
[PowerSnake](https://github.com/spitfire05/PowerSnake), but with simple graphics!

aka WTF am I doing at my master's degree...?

## Usage

`powershell .\powersnakeGFX [-speed n] [-nosound]`

The `speed` parameter accepts values of 1-5 (defaults to 3).

The `nosound` parameter can bu used to surpress console beep on snake collision.

## Current state

Wrapped-up in ASAP mode. Still has few graphical glitches (elements overdrawing), but is 100% playable and should be stable.
